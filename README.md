# Scavenger-Hunt-Web-App

## What does our app do?
Players are able to locate their closest park to start looking for five treasure chests. They will be instructed to find these chests (one by one) by
the given direction pointer. Upon finding the last chest, they will be given a key. The key will unlock the locked door that is displayed on the map and
they will win the game.

Scavenger Hunt Web appication is the final group project for CST 438.
It combines technologies like Flask, Socketio, API calls, and React to 
display and interact with a map to find "chests" on the screen via park location.

The biggest problem was getting the database to work on Heroku. 

## How would you improve it if you had more time?
